Thank you for providing the additional context! Based on your description, it seems that:

- The default branch (`main`) is up to date with the remote.
- Your feature branch (`branch-hai`) is **7 commits behind** the remote (`origin/branch-hai`) and has **1 local commit ahead** (un-pushed).

### Here’s how you can handle this situation:

### **Goal:** Sync `branch-hai` with the remote `origin/branch-hai`, while deciding whether to keep or discard your local changes.

### Option 1: **If You Want to Keep Your Local Commit (1 ahead)**

If you want to keep the changes you made locally (the "1 ahead"), but also bring in the 7 commits that are ahead of your branch on the remote (`origin/branch-hai`), you should merge or rebase the changes.

#### Steps:
1. **Ensure you're on the correct branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout branch-hai
   ```

2. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

3. **Rebase your changes onto `origin/branch-hai`:**
   This will apply your local commit on top of the latest remote changes.

   ```bash
   git rebase origin/branch-hai
   ```

   - If there are conflicts during the rebase, Git will pause and allow you to resolve them.
   - After resolving any conflicts, run:
     ```bash
     git add <resolved_files>
     git rebase --continue
     ```

4. **Push your changes back to the remote:**
   After the rebase is complete, you’ll need to **force push** the changes since rebasing rewrites history:

   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease origin branch-hai
   ```

### Option 2: **If You Want to Discard Your Local Changes and Sync with Remote**

If you don't care about your local commit and simply want to reset your branch to match `origin/branch-hai` (the remote branch), you can reset your branch.

#### Steps:
1. **Ensure you're on the correct branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout branch-hai
   ```

2. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

3. **Reset your branch to `origin/branch-hai`:**
   This will discard your local changes and reset your local branch to match the remote branch.

   ```bash
   git reset --hard origin/branch-hai
   ```

4. **Push (if needed):**
   If you've already pushed commits that are no longer part of your local branch (due to the reset), you'll need to force-push to the remote:

   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease origin branch-hai
   ```

### Option 3: **If You Want to Completely Discard Everything (and Start from `main`)**

If you want to **start over** from `main` (i.e., discard everything in `branch-hai` and make it exactly like the latest `main` branch), here's how you can do that:

#### Steps:
1. **Ensure you're on `branch-hai`:**
   ```bash
   git checkout branch-hai
   ```

2. **Reset `branch-hai` to `main`:**
   This will make your `branch-hai` exactly match `origin/main` and discard any local commits.

   ```bash
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```

3. **Push the reset state to the remote:**
   After resetting, if you want the remote `branch-hai` to match `origin/main` exactly, force-push it:

   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease origin branch-hai
   ```

### Summary of Options:

1. **Keep Local Commit and Rebase:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/branch-hai
   git push --force-with-lease origin branch-hai
   ```

2. **Discard Local Changes and Reset to Remote:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git reset --hard origin/branch-hai
   git push --force-with-lease origin branch-hai
   ```

3. **Completely Discard Local Changes and Start Fresh from `main`:**
   ```bash
   git reset --hard origin/main
   git push --force-with-lease origin branch-hai
   ```

---

### Important Notes:
- **Force Push:** Both `git reset --hard` and `git rebase` might require a `--force-with-lease` push, because you're rewriting the commit history of your local branch.
- **Check for Uncommitted Changes:** If you have uncommitted changes, either stash them or commit them before resetting or rebasing.
