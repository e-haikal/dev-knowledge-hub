#### Issue Title: Duplicate Class Errors in TensorFlow Lite Integration

---

**Description:**
- Encountered duplicate class errors while trying to integrate TensorFlow Lite into my Android project. The errors indicated multiple versions of TensorFlow Lite libraries were being pulled into the project, causing conflicts.

**Environment:**
- **Device:** Emulator
- **OS Version:** Android 11
- **Development Tools:** Android Studio 2023.1
- **Libraries/Dependencies:** 
  - tensorflow-lite-support: 0.1.0
  - tensorflow-lite-task-vision: 0.4.4
  - tensorflow-lite-api: 2.13.0

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Add TensorFlow Lite dependencies in `build.gradle` with mixed versions.
2. Sync the project and build.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Project should compile successfully without any duplicate class errors.

**Actual Behavior:**
- Compilation failed with multiple duplicate class errors related to TensorFlow Lite classes.

**Root Cause:**
- Conflicting versions of TensorFlow Lite libraries were included in the project, resulting in duplicate classes.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Aligned all TensorFlow Lite library versions to `2.13.0` and `0.4.4`.
2. Added `implementation("org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:2.13.0")` to the dependencies.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Ensure all library versions are consistent to avoid conflicts, especially when working with dependencies that have transitive dependencies.
