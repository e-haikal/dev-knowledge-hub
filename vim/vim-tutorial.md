To search for text in Vim:

1. Press `/` followed by the text you want to search for.
2. Press `Enter` to start the search.
3. Use `n` to go to the next occurrence and `N` to go to the previous occurrence.

## 7. Customizing Vim

Vim can be customized through a configuration file called `.vimrc`. You can set options, define shortcuts, and more. For example, adding the following line to your `.vimrc` will enable line numbers:
